# Chiseled!

Minecraft has a lot of Chiseled variants of its decorative blocks, but they're all a bit different and don't fit with each other.

Some have a monster's face on, others just have a pattern. Some have a smooth and unchiseled top but others have the design on all faces. With this resource pack, all of the Chiseled blocks feature the face of a common enemy on them, as well as a uniform design.

## Bedrock Port
The Bedrock port was created for me by [NeraWoowty](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/neraminusminus/). [Contact them](https://nerawoowty.github.io/contact.html) regarding it, as I do not have much experience with Bedrock RPs.
