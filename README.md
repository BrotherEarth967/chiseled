# Chiseled!

Minecraft has a lot of Chiseled variants of its decorative blocks, but they're all a bit different and don't fit with each other.

Some have a monster's face on, others just have a pattern. Some have a smooth and unchiseled top but others have the design on all faces. With this resource pack, all of the Chiseled blocks feature the face of a common enemy on them, as well as a uniform design.
